# Jan 05 R wokshop

This one day workshop is a gentle introduction to R. 

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has

- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or on hardcopy, and
- a well developed, simple and effective programming language (called ‘S’) which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities. 

R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive data analysis. It has developed rapidly, and has been extended by a large collection of packages. However, most programs written in R are essentially ephemeral, written for a single piece of data analysis.

I recommend these materials for further exploration:
- [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)
- [The Art of R Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515029845&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+r+programming)
- [Statistical Computing Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Computing-Chapman-Hall-CRC/dp/1584885459/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515029903&sr=1-1&keywords=statistical+computing+with+r)

Or, perhaps the most useful source is from online forums
