# Jan 05 R wokshop

This one day workshop is a gentle introduction to R. R is a free software contains a lot of potentials.

I recommend these materials for further exploration:
- [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)
- [The Art of R Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515029845&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+r+programming)
- [Statistical Computing Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Computing-Chapman-Hall-CRC/dp/1584885459/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515029903&sr=1-1&keywords=statistical+computing+with+r)

Or, perhaps the most useful source is online forums

- [R blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/?tagnames=r&sort=active)
- [R Tutorial](http://www.r-tutor.com/)
